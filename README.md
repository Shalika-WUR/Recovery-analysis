1. Global anlaysis.R includes the codes used in the study "How do farming systems recover from production shocks? A global resilience analysis." by Vyas et. al (forthcoming)
2. Combined_Report_maize_compressed: This file is part of the working paper entitled "How do farming systems recover from production shocks? A global resilience analysis." by Vyas et. al (forthcoming). It includes country-wise graphs showing (LOESS fit over time, residuals vs lag-1 residuals and Cook's distance over time) for maize production systems. The countries are denoted by their ISO3 identifiers.
